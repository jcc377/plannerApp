# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I struggled with this assignment - I spent too much time on trying to save locally my text in the planner that I was unable to dedicate time to research and figure out how to make the row and column colors change as a function of time. Also, I kept getting a 404 error when I published my planner app in github, even though it would open naturally from VSCode - what's going on there? This happened to me last week too. 

I thought I had the local storage figured git out - I tried to use the 04 module's activity #20 (the todos exercise) as a reference, it was quite helpful but I still fell short.
